# How to run

To compile the programs use <code>make all</code>

The different programs can the be run by typing <code>programname.exe<code> in your teminal

performance.exe can be run manualy by providing T which is the number of threads and N which is the size of the array in MB as argumnets
But it can also be run via the run-combinations.sh script

dining.exe is the provided code which deadlock and require N which is the number of philosophers as an argument

diningSolved.exe is the our solution to the problem and require N which is the number of philosophers as an argument
